  "readme": "# passport-stub\n\nPassport.js stub for testing. | Based on Jonathon Kresner's ([@jkresner](https://github.com/jkresner)) [post](http://hackerpreneurialism.com/post/48344246498/node-js-testing-mocking-authenticated-passport-js).\n\nWritten with the idea of being simple to use.\n\n## Usage\nI've been writing my [Express](http://expressjs.com/) API tests with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), so here is an example:\n\n```coffeescript\npassportStub = require 'passport-stub'\nrequest      = require 'supertest'\napp          = require '../app'\n\npassportStub.install app\nreq = request app\n\ndescribe 'GET /admin', ->\n\n  it 'responds with 401 if not logged in', (done) ->\n    req.get('/admin').expect(401).end done\n\n  it 'responds with 200 when logged in', (done) ->\n    passportStub.login username: 'john.doe'\n    req.get('/admin').expect(200).end done\n```\nThe user you log in with can be whatever user your app would expect to deal with. It could be a mongoose model, for example.\n\n## Functions\n - `.install(app)`\n - `.uninstall()`\n - `.login(user)`\n - `.logout()`\n\n## Notes\nAlthough I didn't use, I've included a few other functions that might be useful. The code itself is pretty simple, so take a look at it.\n\nThis module was written in coffee because that was what I was currently using in a project. Feel free to suggest improvements and even a rewrite in javascript.\n\n\n## License\nThis is licensed under the feel-free-to-do-whatever-you-want-to-do license.\n\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/gtramontina/passport-stub/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n\n",
